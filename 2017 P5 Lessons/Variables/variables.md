#Variables

Think of a variable as a box. Its job is to hold something. Often times we are going to use a variable to hold a number. We can change the variable, which would change the number. The most important thing to know about variables is that if we want something to change in your program (size, position, color, etc.) then you have to use a variable.

Watch the video below to learn how to use the `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables. follow along with the code widget.

Create a program using variables that moves one circle from right to left and another circle in the opposite direction. Note, your circles should go off the canvas and not return. You will learn how to do that in another lesson.
