# Offline Coding

Previously, all of your work has been done through a website. You are going to start coding on your own computer now. To do this you will need a text editor and some JavaScript files. Read through the sections below and get the appropriate software on your computer. Please be sure to show the teacher your setup before moving on to the next lessons.

## Required Software
Be sure that you have the following software on your machine:

* Download and install the [Atom text editor](http://atom.io)
* There are several code editing programs out there. Atom is what I choose to use. Microsoft has [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), while Adobe offers [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). Windows users can download [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). While these programs will differ slightly in appearance, they all do the same thing.
* Atom allows you to install packages to help you code. Follow these [instructions](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/) to install `atom-beautify` which makes your code look nice and neat.
* You can also [install themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmES177IL2M) if you want to customize how your editor looks.

## Project Files
You need to download the `P5 Template` folder below. Double-click on the zipped folder. Drag the normal `P5 Template` folder to some place on your computer. The Desktop or the Documents folder would work. For each project, make a copy of the `P5 Template` folder and rename it. Do your coding in `sketch.js` file, and view your output in the `index.html` file.
