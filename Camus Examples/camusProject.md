# Camus Project

### Goal
Create an interactive project that reinforces one of the Camus themes that you have studied.

### Project
You will turn in two items: an interactive program and a paragraph that explains the connection between the code and Camus. A good explanation will be detailed and include references to the texts when appropriate.

### Camus Themes
**Mme. Collard**
* Le regard de l'autre
* Être différent
* l'écriture de soi

**Mme.**
* Exile
* Death penalty
* Identity
* Racism
* Judicial system

**M. Dufreines**

### Coding Ideas
* Alter an image of yourself
  * See video [11.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUMZ5YRxHI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aKKsDHZdDvN6oCJ2hRY_Ig&index=3)
  * Keep in mind the canvas must be the same size as the image
* Alter the video from your webcam
  * See videos [11.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNqaw8LT2ZU&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aKKsDHZdDvN6oCJ2hRY_Ig&index=4), [11.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1G6WBvrOBE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aKKsDHZdDvN6oCJ2hRY_Ig&index=5),[11.6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V3uYA1hafk&index=6&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aKKsDHZdDvN6oCJ2hRY_Ig), or [11.8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdKep6jo7b0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aKKsDHZdDvN6oCJ2hRY_Ig&index=8)
  * Each of the above videos is a separate project. Take a look at all of them to see which you like best.
* Alter your voice with speech recognition
  * See videos [10.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slmSCEho31g), [10.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf8w1BJb9Xc), [10.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CHV33wDsI), [10.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_bXBcmfTJM), and Coding Challenges [#79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGe1m_bLOFk) and [#80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTgphKCP9U)
  * The early videos are used to make a chat bot. These chat bots are later modified to make use of speech recognition. It may be best to start with the early videos even if you do not intend to make a chat bot.
  * Videos 10.3 and 10.4 are the speech videos you definitely want to watch.
* If you really want a challenge, think about how the Matrix code (from the movie) relates to the themes of Camus
